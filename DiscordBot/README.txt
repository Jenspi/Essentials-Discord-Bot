Patch notes:
6/28/23:
	CHANGES– REMOVED online status of bot; REMOVED Age.java and ServerAge.java for outdated commands !age and !sage, respectively, that showed the user's account creation date and their server join date, which are now permanent features on Discord.
	QUESTIONS–
		1. How to set bot status to DND?
		2. Difference between Rest Ping and Gateway Ping?
		3. Difference between sendMessageEmbeds and sendMessageComponents?
		4. What was I doing with Art and Draw classes?

		5. Can I share my code on GitHub without my token exposed? Should I even share it publicly?
		6. Do I need bin file? What else do I not need to upload? Is there a perms file to include? Can someone run this without adding it to the discord dev portal? How exactly would someone run this if they had/did not have the code?
		7. When do I do version releases? How do I keep track of all of these updates/patch notes? Do I do all of these only with official releases? How do I know when to do an official release? What is industry standard to number the versions?
		8. Shard info? Rest actions?
	//TODO
		1. Find new bot picture/give credit
		2. Figure out token situation
		3. Figure out how to host bot
		4. Update front page README.md for overall project

		5. Roles class (react for roles; not started)
		6. Link GitHub, credits and whatnot in Discord and code
		7. Figure out why I have unused lines of code... what was I going to do with them?
		8. Figure out what I was going to do with Art and Draw classes
		9. Fix !choose
		10. Fix !clear
